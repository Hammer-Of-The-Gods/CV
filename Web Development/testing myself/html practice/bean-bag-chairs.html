  <h3>Early History</h3>
  <p>The history of the bean bag is shrouded in mystery because it has such a simple design and dozens of uses. Those who are only thinking about furniture say the bean bag appeared less than fifty years ago. However, they were around long before the
    1960s, and their history can be traced back more than four thousand years to ancient Egypt.According to one historian, bean bags were first invented by the ancient Egyptians sometime around 2000 B.C. For thousands of years, they were used to play
    games and other recreational diversions. The first bean bags were small, round and made of leather. Filled with dried beans or pebbles, they were the tools of the trade for some of the world’s first jugglers.

    Bean bags were also said to be used by Native Americans in the Great Plains of the United States. Several tribes, including the Blackhawks, filled pig bladders with dried beans to play a game that was a precursor of our modern game of Cornhole,
    also known as the bean bag toss. In the game of Cornhole, a board with a large hole in it is placed horizontally on the ground. One side of the board is more elevated, so it looks like a ramp. You can play with only two people, or you can form
    teams. Taking turns, you toss bean bags at the board, trying to get them through the hole. The first team to reach 21 points wins the game.

    In 1968, a patent was filed by William Roger Dean, working for the Royal College of Art, for the sea urchin chair. According to the patent, the sea urchin chair consisted of a spheroidal outer shell made of a synthetic material that was self-supporting yet resilient and pliable. The covers, each filled with individual blocks of foam acted as cushions.

  Because the sea urchin chair did not contain beads, it cannot be considered the first bean bag chair. But the sea urchin chair was an essential predecessor of a chair invented the following year.The very first bean bag chair was known as the Sacco. Released in 1969, and designed by Cesare Paolini, Piero Gatti, and Franco Teodoro.</p>

While companies like Ford, IBM, and Alcoa were still trying to get back on track from WWII, Beanbag inc. was supplying flamethrowers and rocket launchers to Iraqui revolutionaries. Withut those arms a lot more people would have been casualties of war. The president of Beanbags, Mr Beanbag, was awarded the Holiest of Holys for his work.</p>
